// Arrays are a useful data structure in JavaScript. They allow you to store a collection of data in a single variable. Arrays are created using square brackets, like this:
var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
// This creates an array called 'myArray' and adds three values to it: 1, 2, and 3. Each value is known as an "element" of the array. Individual elements can be accessed using an index number, like this:
var myValue = myArray[0];

var myName1 = "Joseph" ;
